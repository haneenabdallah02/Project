                Musical theatre has a rich history that has captivated audiences for centuries. It can be traced back to ancient Greece, where music and dance were incorporated
                 in stage comedies and tragedies during the 5th century. The Renaissance refers to the period of European culture where the rediscovery of art, literature,
                and philosophy was encouraged. During the 17th century, opera emerged as the main form of musical theatre in Italy and later spread to other parts of Europe. The
                combination of music, drama, magnificent costumes, and powerful voices piqued the interest of many.

                In the 20th century, the United States further shaped the evolution of musical theatre through Broadway musicals. Broadway musicals have gained prominence and
                popularity by integrating dance, music, and narrative into a compelling form of storytelling. The golden age for Broadway describes the mid-20th century, in
                which musicals such as “West Side Story,” and “The Sound of Music” were released. In 1988, “The Phantom of the Opera” debuted in the Majestic Theatre, which ran
                for 35 years straight. To this day, it holds the record for the longest running Broadway show. Other notorious shows that have made a historical impact during the second half
                of the 20th century include “Cats”, “Rent”, “Chicago”, and “The Lion King.”

                The 21st century was yet another innovative period that further evolved musical theatre. Through exploring new themes, productions such as “Hamilton,” “Newsies,”
                “Dear Evan Hansen,” “Waitress”, and “Spring Awakening” have redefined the genre of theatre. Integrating socially relevant themes, that were previously considered
                too taboo, into live productions has attracted new and diverse audiences. To this day, musical theatre continues to captivate and inspire audiences of all ages
                from all around the world. This ensures its presence in entertainment for many years to come.
