                <p>Having had the privilege to see MJ the Musical twice, I can confidently say this is one of my all time favorite shows. Growing up listening to
                    Michael Jackson and the Jackson 5, this production felt very personal. The entire cast perfected each performance, and did the King of Pop
                    justice. I sat in the orchestra the first time, and in the front mezzanine the second time. Both seats provided a great view, but I did prefer
                    the mezzanine seat. I had a clear and centered view of the entire stage, and the elevated angle ensured no audience members blocked my view.
                    From the dancing to the signing, the lead actor was able to provide the joy Michael Jackson brought to the world through his
                    performances. I strongly recommend this show to anyone, but especially if Michael Jackson holds a special place in your heart like he does in
                    mine.

            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>The storytelling of Hadestown left me astounded from the very beginning. Hadestown is the tragic retelling of the ancient Greek myth of Orpheus
                    and Eurydice. While searching for food to eat, a starving Eurydice finds herself working in the hellish industrial underworld run by Hades. Although
                    starving and impoverished himself, her poor songwriter and lover Orpheus attempts to rescue her. While there was not much dancing in this show,
                    I clearly received the message of the importance of trying even if we fail. This story highlights good and evil, the wealthy and those in poverty,
                    and the power or lack-of that comes with each. The exploration of power dynamics when it comes to love and societal structures was one of the main
                    takeaways of the show. The music was beyond powerful, and ranges from folk to jazz to blues. I sat towards the back of the orchestra center, and I
                    fondly remember having a perfect view of the entire stage. The theatre is much smaller compared to others on Broadway, so it allows a more intimate
                    experience regardless of where one sits. I highly recommend this show for anyone, especially if it is your first Broadway experience!</p>

            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>Miss Saigon is the first Broadway show I have ever seen, and certainly left its mark on me. This production tells the story of American GI, Chris,
                    who is drafted to fight in the Vietnam War. While in Vietnam, he meets and falls in love with Kim, a Vietnamese orphan who works as a bar-girl
                    and prostitute. They are eventually torn apart when Chris returns to the U.S. He returns years later to Bangkok with his American wife Ellen, only
                    to find out that Kim not only survived the war, but also has given birth to Chris’ son. In truth, this show was entirely heart-wrenching, and does
                    not take on light themes by any means. It certainly transports the audience to Vietnam and tells the true story of many who have been impacted by
                    war. The music is beautiful, and tells of human cost and resilience during the darkest moments in history. For this experience I sat in what could
                    only be described as the nosebleeds, and overall it was not a great view. While this show is no longer running on Broadway, it was filmed and is
                    available for streaming. I recommend this show for a mature audience only because it deals with serious themes that are not kid-friendly.

                <p>I had the privilege of participating in the Hamilton Project in 2018 during high school. At this time, two classmates and myself had the opportunity
                    to perform an original rap about Benjamin Franklin. This show is an incredible twist on the mundane history we are taught in school. Each
                    song, written by Lin Manuel Miranda, brilliantly combines the U.S. historical narrative and hip-hop, R&B, and traditional Broadway styles. It tells
                    the powerful story of the Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, highlighting themes of ambition, legacy, and leadership. This show made me have a
                    better understanding of U.S. history, and truly assisted me in excelling in my high school history courses. For this show, I sat in the third row of
                    the right orchestra. While this may seem like a fantastic seat, it was too close and partially obscured my view of the stage. I highly recommend
                    everyone sees this show, as it encourages those to “rise up” and achieve goals one sets for themselves.</p>

                <p>This show was purely a fun time! The well-loved songs and performances were fantastic as it mirrors the original disney film. This show tells the
                    timeless tale of two sisters, Elsa and Anna, that are pulled apart by Elsa’s power of creating and controlling snow and ice. I sat in the mezzanine
                    for this show, and had a fantastic view. Although I do recommend this family-friendly show, sadly it is no longer on Broadway.</p>
